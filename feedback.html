				<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>CUSTOMER FEEDBACK and Other fun stuff that people like to talk about, like birds, and busses and Chuck Norris.  Sometimes they like to go off tangent and talk about their kids and that one time that they "accidentally" locked them out of the car when that bear was attacking while on the UI floating trip.  Or how they RANDOMLY decided to give the marshmallows to the racoon instead of having them available to make smores...  </b></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<td> My minions and i have found it such a chore to find those high-end quality treasures, but thanks to Charbel we've been getting more and more publicity for less and less work!  Whether it be a small bank robbery, to an art forgery or even stealing one of the pyramids - we have never had an issue with Charbel's service and can't wait to see what new shiny thing he comes out with next.  Thanks Charbel! </td>
